BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

Your business is SURVIVING but not THRIVING.

You're breaking even with almost no margin for error. One bad month or 
unexpected expense could put you in the red. The good news: you have a solid 
customer base and consistent income. Focus on:

1. Reducing that 17% bank charge (biggest quick win)
2. Understanding and controlling the 24% "Other" expenses
3. Converting more one-time customers to repeat business
4. Slight price increase (even 5%) would dramatically improve margins

You're close to profitability - small improvements will make a big difference!
